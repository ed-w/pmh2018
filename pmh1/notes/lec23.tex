\section{2018-05-30 Lecture}

Recall that $\Delta^n$ has a canonical $\Delta$-simplex structure and $H_n^\Delta(\Delta^k,\p\Delta^k) \isoto H_n(\Delta^k,\p\Delta^k)$ where the isomorphism is induced by the canonical map on homology groups (interpreting regular simplices as singular simplices).

For an arbitrary $\Delta$-complex $X$, we have $X^k = \bigcup_{n_\alpha \leq k} \im\sigma_\alpha$.
We can prove similarly that $H_n^\Delta(X^k,X^{k-1}) \isoto H_n(X^k,X^{k-1})$.
We can also show that $H_n^\Delta(X^k) \isoto H_n(X^k)$ for all $k$ and so $H_n^\Delta(X) \isoto H_n(X)$ and $H_n^\Delta(X,A) \isoto H_n(A)$ for each subcomplex $A$.

5.3 Cellular homology

Let $X=X^l$ be an $l$-dimensional cell complex with attaching maps $\ph_\alpha: S^{k-1} \to X^{k-1}$ for $k \leq l$.
Then $X^k = X^{k-1} \sqcup_\ph \coprod_\alpha D_\alpha^k$ and $X^k = X^{k-1} \amalg \coprod \mr D_\alpha^k$ as sets with corresponding $k$-cells $e_\alpha^k = \mr D_\alpha^k$.
We also have $X = \amalg_{k,\alpha} e_\alpha^k$ as sets.

\begin{defn}
  Let $C_n^{CW}(X)$ be the free abelian group generated by the $n$-cells in $X$.
  We have a group homomorphism
  \begin{align*}
    \p_n^{CW}: C_n^{CW}(X) &\to C_{n-1}^{CW}(X) \\
    e_\alpha^n &\mapsto \sum_\beta d_{\alpha\beta}e_\beta^{n-1} \text{ for } n \geq 1
  \end{align*}
  where
  \[ d_{\alpha\beta} = \deg\ph_{\alpha\beta}: S^{n-1} \xto{\ph_\alpha} X^{n-1} \xto{q} X^n/(X^{n-1} \setminus e_\beta^{n-1}) \isoto D_\beta^{n-1}/\p D_\beta^{n-1} \isoto S^{n-1}. \]
\end{defn}

Recall that $H_n(X^n,X^{n-1}) \cong \ZZ^{\#\ n\text{-cells}} = C_n^{CW}(X)$.
