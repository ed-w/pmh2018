\begin{rmk}[For a question from the 2018-04-10 lecture]
	Let $X = \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha$ with $x_0 \in \bigcap_\alpha A_\alpha$ with each $A_\alpha \cap A_\beta$ path connected.
	Then $\Phi: *_\alpha \pi_1(A_\alpha,x_0) \to \pi_1(X,x_0)$ is surjective.
	If each $A_\alpha \cap A_\beta \cap A_\gamma$ is path connected, then van Kampen's theorem tells us that $\ker\Phi$ is generated by $\pi_1(A_\alpha \cap A_\beta, x_0)$.
	
	What if this triple-wise intersection property is not satisfied?
	Let $x_1 \in A_\alpha \cap A_\beta \cap A_\gamma$ such that there is no path in the intersection from $x_0$ to $x_1$.
	Define paths
	\begin{align*}
		f &\text{ from } x_0 \text{ to } x_1 \text{ in } A_\alpha \cap A_\beta \\
		g &\text{ from } x_0 \text{ to } x_1 \text{ in } A_\alpha \cap A_\gamma \\
		h &\text{ from } x_0 \text{ to } x_1 \text{ in } A_\beta \cap A_\gamma \\
	\end{align*}
	Then
	\begin{align*}
		l_\alpha = f \cdot \bar g &\text{ in } A_\alpha \\
		l_\beta = h \cdot \bar g &\text{ in } A_\beta \\
		l_\gamma = g \cdot \bar h &\text{ in } A_\gamma \\
	\end{align*}
	So $l_\alpha \cdot l_\beta \cdot l_\gamma \simeq c$, the constant loop.
	Then $[l_\beta][l_\alpha][l_\gamma] \in *_\alpha \pi_1(A_\alpha,x_0)$.

\begin{prop}[Uniqueness of lifts]
	Let $f: Y \to X$ with $Y$ connected.
	For two lifts $\wt f_1, \wt f_2: Y \to \wt X$, they agree at one point in $Y$ $ \iff \wt f_1 = \wt f_2$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	$\impliedby$ is trivial.
	We prove $\implies$.
	
	Let $S = \{y \in Y \mid \wt f_1(y) = \wt f_2(y)\}$.
	Let $T = Y \setminus S$.
	For any $y \in Y$, let $U$ be an evenly covered open neighbourhood in $X$ about $f(y)$.
	Then $p\inv[U] = \coprod_\alpha V_\alpha$, so $\wt f_1(y) \in V_\alpha$ and $\wt f_2(y) \in V_\beta$ for some sheets $V_\alpha$ and $V_\beta$.
	Now define $N_y = \wt f_1\inv[V_\alpha] \cap \wt f_2\inv[V_\beta]$.
	It is clear that $y \in N_y \subseteq Y$ and $N_y$ is open in $Y$.
	
	We now show that $T$ is open.
	If $y \in T$ then $\alpha\neq\beta$.
	Then $\wt f_1[N_y] \subseteq V_\alpha$, $\wt f_2[N_y] \subseteq V_\beta$ and $\wt f_1[N_y] \cap \wt f_2[N_y] = \emptyset$.
	Therefore $\wt f_1$ and $\wt f_2$ do not agree on $N$, hence $N_y \subseteq T$.
	
	We now show that $S$ is open.
	If $y \in S$, then $\alpha=\beta$.
	Then we have
	\[N_y \underset{\wt f_2}{\overset{\wt f_1}{\rightrightarrows}} V_\alpha \xto{p} U\]
	Since $p$ is injective, this means that $\wt f_1$ and $\wt f_2$ agree on $N_y$, hence $N_y \subseteq S$.
	
	Then since $Y$ is open and $Y = S \amalg T$, we must have $T=\emptyset$.
\end{proof}

3.3 Classification of covering spaces

\begin{defn}
	An isomorphism between covering spaces $p_1: \wt X_1 \to X$ and $p_2: \wt X_2 \to X$ is a homeomorphism $f: \wt X_1 \to \wt X_2$ with $p_1=p_2f$.
	We can analogously define an isomorphism between pointed spaces by making the maps preserve basepoints.
\end{defn}

We will study connected covering spaces of PLPC spaces (then the covering space is automatically PLPC).

\begin{thm}[Classification of covering spaces/Galois correspondence]
        If $X$ is PLPC and semilocally simply connected, then there is a bijection between isoclasses of connected coverings of $(X,x_0)$ and subgroups of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ given by
        \[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]
                (\wt{x},\wt{x}_0) \ar[dd, swap, "p"] & \\
                \ar[r, leftrightarrow] & p_*\left(\pi_1(\wt X,\wt x_0)\right) \leq \pi_1(X,x_0) \\
                (X,x_0) &
        \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{thm}

\begin{prop}
	Let $X$ be PLPC.
	Then two covering spaces $p_1: (\wt X_1,\wt x_1) \to (X,x_0)$ and $p_2: (\wt X_2,\wt x_2) \to (X,x_0)$ are isomorphic $\iff$ ${p_1}_*(\pi_1(\wt X,\wt x_1)) = {p_2}_*(\pi_1(\wt X,\wt x_2))$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	$\impliedby$:
	By the lifting criterion we have two maps $\phi: (\wt X_1,\wt x_1) \to (\wt X_2,\wt x_2)$ and $\psi: (\wt X_2,\wt x_2) \to (\wt X_1,\wt x_1)$.
	Then $\psi\phi(\wt x_1) = \wt x_1 = 1_{\wt X_1}(\wt x_1)$, and $p_1\psi\phi = p_2\phi = p_1 = p_11_{\wt X_1}$.
So $\phi\psi$ and $1_{\wt X_1}$ are lifts through $p_1$ of $p_1$.
	Then by the previous proposition they are equal.
	Similarly, $\psi\phi=1_{\wt X_2}$.
\end{proof}
